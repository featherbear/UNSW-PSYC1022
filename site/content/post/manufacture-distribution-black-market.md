## Amphetamine-Type Stimulants (ATS)

> Amphetamines, Methamphetamine, Ecstasy

Seizures of ATS drugs have increased since 2008

### Methamphetamine

Meth productions have been increasing; but so have the seizures of them

# Black Market Value

Costs of drugs increase the further they move away from the source of production.  
At each step in the chain of distribution, each party gains a higher profit
