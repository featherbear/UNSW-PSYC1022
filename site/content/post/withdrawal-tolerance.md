# Diagnostic Definition

Defines the list of disorders per disorder

## General Symptoms

* Overdose
* Addiction
* Attempt to break free from use
* Craving
* Failure of public duty
* Use despite ongoing interpersonal issues
* Dismissal of social, occupational or recreational activities
* Use despite damaging effects
* Tolerance - need to take more to feel the same
* Withdrawal

***

# Tolerance

> Super-optimal Binding

* "A need to increase substance dose to achieve intoxication or desired effect"
* "A diminished effect with the same amount of the substance"

To remain healthy, neurons need to fire with a certain frequency. If they are fired too frequently/infrequently, neurotoxicity can occur.

* If the drug acts on inhibitory receptors - the cell with under-fire
* If the drug acts on excitatory receptors - the cell with over-fire

After drugs have been administered, the dose-response curve is effectively shifted to the right (more dosage required for same effect). In addition, the maximum response lowers as a result of receptor desensitisation and down regulation.

## Receptor Desensitisation

To protect themselves from super-optimal receptor binding (i.e. triggered through drugs), neurons will cause receptors of the ion channels on the cell membrane to become insensitive, such that binding to the receptor has no impact on the excitation/inhibition

## Down Regulation

Another method that the body performs, is to decrease the number of receptors

# Withdrawal

> Supra-optimal binding

* "Having experienced the characteristic withdrawal syndrome for the substance"
* "The substance (or a related substance) is taken to relieve or avoid withdrawal symptoms"

## Alcohol (Depressant) Withdrawal

Alcohol works on glutamates, GABA, dopamine and opioids to produce relaxation.

Less GABA (less inhibition) and increased glutamate (increased excitation) causes over-excitation of brain activity. It is important for alcohol reduction programs to ease the decreased usage of alcohol, rather than fully abstain (Craig et al.)

## Stimulant Withdrawal

The withdrawal of stimulant drugs produce the reversed effects - loss of motivation, depression, anxiety

* Active cell count decreases during withdrawal

Peak: 2 days  
Duration: 10 days

## Cannabis Withdrawal

A study on rats (Breivogel et al. 1999) found that rats experienced receptor desensitisation and down regulation of CB1 in the cerebellum, hippocampus and striatum.

* Anger, anxiety, sleep disturbance, etc

Peak: 1 week  
Symptoms last around 27 days
