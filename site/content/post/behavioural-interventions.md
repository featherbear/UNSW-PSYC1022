# What is Behavioural Intervention?

Interactions between clients and a treatment practitioner (doctor, psychiatrist, clinical psychologist, counsellor). That often take place in a medical office or hospital setting, and can happen either in groups or privately

# Relapse Rates

Those who enter treatment often have a comorbid dysregulation i.e. through psychiatric illnesses, cognitive impairments, impulsivity.

> Hunt (1971) - Abstinence rate tends to drop, indicative of relapse
>
> Hughes (2004) - Similar relapse rates can be seen in self-quitters as well as those who have gone through professional treatment

# Project MATCH

US$27M trial that randomly allocated alcohol patients into one of three treatment programmes.

1) Twelve-step facilitation (TSF)  
2) Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT)  
3) Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET)

## Twelve-Step Facilitation (TSF)

Based on the "12-step fellowships". Willpower alone cannot achieve sustained sobriety, rather the desire for the greater good and spiritual renewal

**Main goals**

* Acceptance for the need of abstinence
* Willingness to participate
