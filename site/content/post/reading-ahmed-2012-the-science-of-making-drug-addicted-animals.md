Researchers attempt to make animals addicted to drugs, in order to better understand the neuroscience of drug addiction

> Why do only a few people transition into being drug-addicted?

As a result of the limitations in spatial and temporal brain imaging, the origin, nature and casual effectiveness of cortical changes are largely unknown

"Mental Disorder" - A harmful behavioural or psychological condition that reflects an underlying dysfunction in the individual, particularly in its brain. ADD: **that conflicts with society's expectable response**

***

A heroin-withdrawn baby born from a mother addicted to heroin is physically dependent, **but not dependent** on heroin. (O'Brien 2011)

People may take drugs out of functionality, rationality and of their own will, rather than out of compulsion.

# Harder than it seems

The idea of making a rat addicted to cocaine, then comparing its neuropathological alterations to a normal rat ... isn't that simple.

It has also been unable to lead to any significant translational impact for both medical diagnosis and treatment

***

For animals to be considered as having an addiction-like behaviour, they must be self-administering, and develop/present an array of changes that display important behavioural features of addiction

> Ahmed and Koob 1998

Two groups of rats were given access to cocaine, one group for 1 hr, the other for 6+ hours a day. Those in the extended time session injected more doses over time.

* Escalate cocaine intake
* Work harder
* Accept increased costs to obtain the drug
* Became more vulnerable to stress
* Higher tendency to reinstate their intoxication after extinction

Those in the extended group, when exposed to footshocks, resumed consuming the cocaine faster than the control group - difficulty in abstaining
