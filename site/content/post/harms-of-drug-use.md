# Burden of Disease

1. Prevalence & exposure to substances
2. Proportion of "problem users"
3. Disease categories that are linked to use of the substance

* Years lived in ill health or with disability (YLD) - Non-fatal burden
* Years of life lost (YLL) - Fatal burden
* Disability-adjusted life years (DALY) - YLD + YLL

Note: #3 alcohol, #6 tobacco, #18 illicit drugs

### Estimates

Tobacco, alcohol and illicit drug use was 15.9% of the proportion of DALY.  
Burden of disease is greater in males (19%) compared to females (12.4%) - AIHW 2019

#### Tobacco, alcohol, illicit drug use

* 18% of deaths
  * 21% male, 15% female
* 22% of YLL (fatal)
  * 24% male, 19% female
* 10% YLD (non-fatal)
  * 13% male, 7.7%

#### Tobacco

Leading risk factor to burden (9.3%)

13\.3% deaths (20933)

\~1.5x male prevalence

* 10.5% 2003
* 9.8% 2011
* 9.3% 2015

#### Alcohol

4\.6% burden

3\.4% deaths (5039)

\~3x male prevalence

Higher in the younger age group 15-54  
Highest 35-44
