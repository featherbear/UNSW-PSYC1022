# Neuropharmacology

> Neuropharmacology - the study of how drugs affect cellular function in the nervous system, and the neural mechanisms through which they influence behaviour.

## The Neuron

Rene Descartes - expansion of fluids within the brain and spine were transduced into muscle movements

Luigi Galvani - animal electricity - induction of muscle movements from sensory information to muscular activity

Camillo Golgi - Discovered a way of visualising brain cells by fixing black silver chromate particles

### Types of Cells

* Dendrites - branch-like structures that receive information/signals from other neurons
* Cell body (soma) - control region which contains the machinery that keeps the neuron alive and functioning
* Axon hillock - region which inputs excitatory and inhibitory input are used to determine whether the cell will 'fire' (action potential) or not
* Axon - thin fibre extending from the soma which is involved in transmitting electrical signals to other neurons
* Myelin sheath - fatty layer that covers portions of the axon, speeds up electrical conduction
* Nodes of Ranvier - allows the electrical charge to jump to each node, speeding conduction
* Terminal buttons - passes the electrical signal to the dendrite of a neighbouring cell (via neutrotransmiter release)

## Neuron Potentials

* Action potential - the process by which an electrical signal is transmitted along an axon

  ### Resting membrane potential

  > Voltage of a neuron when it is not firing
* Potassium ions (K+) in the cell, and charged Sodium ions (Na+) outside
* -70 mV

  ### Action Potential

## Neurotransmission

The process in which an action potential continues along the neighbouring cell

Synaptic cleft - a gap/space between the terminal button and the dendrite (spine) of the neighbouring cell.

> When an action potential reaches an axon terminal, it stimulates the release of neurotransmitter molecules from sacs (vesicles). These molecules cross the _synaptic cleft_ and bind to receptor sites on the receiving neuron.
>
> The sending neuron then re-absorbs excess neurotransmitter molecules - a process known as **reuptake**
