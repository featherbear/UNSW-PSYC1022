# Cannabis


* Originated in the mountainous regions northwest of the Himalayas.
* Two varieties
  * Sativa - Greater fibre content, higher psychotomimetic effects
  * Indica - Lower fibre content and low psychotomimetic effect

* Cannabinoids are the main psychoactive component in the cannabis leaf
  * Phytocannabinoids - found in plants
  * Synthetic - man made
* There are many phytocannabinoids that have been isolated from the cannabis plant, but the most researched ones are THC (delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol) and CBD (cannabidiol)

> "There is initial evidence that although CBD has little psychoactive effect it may reduce the psychotomimetic effect of THC (Jo et al. 1999)"

* Psychoactive effect refers to a change in one's mental state through affecting the functions of the brain and nervous system
* Psychotomimetic effect are the effects of psychosis (hearing, seeing, believing things that aren't real)

* Cannabis can be grown that is low in THC but high in other cannabinoids, which can be used to treat ailments without the psychotic effects
  * Currently there are more positives than negatives of the use of cannabis
  * Classified as prohibited in Australia, but can be used legally for medical/research use

* Synthetic Cannabis
  * Organic chemist John William Huffman synthesised a series of drugs (JWH-018)
