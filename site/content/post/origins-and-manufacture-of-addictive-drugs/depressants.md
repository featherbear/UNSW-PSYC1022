# Alcohol

* Easily made through fermentation
* Highest rates in Europe, Russian, Australia and Canada
* 25% unrecorded consumption (i.e. home-brewed)
* 3.3 million deaths attributed to alcohol consumption

---

* History
  * Jiahu, China (7000-5800BC) - Fermented rice, honey and hawthorn
  * Areni-1 Cave, Armenia (4100BC) - Grapes 

# Opium

* Derived from the sap of a opium poppy seed head
* (The sap acts as an antiherbivore chemical (i.e. pesticide))

* History
  * 10000-2000BC - throughout Europe, Asia, Middle East and North Africa
  * 4200BC - archaeological sites of buried opium
    * Brittany, France
    * Southern Spain
  * Luxor, Egypt (1500BC) - Ebers papyrus described a recipe that used opium
  * "The Odyssey" by Homer (700BC) - Reference

## Morphine (Derived from opium)

* Morphine is extracted from opium (composes 8-14% of opium)
* In 1803, German pharmacist Friedrich Serturner added morphine crystals into food, which killed unwanted rats and dogs.
  * Observed that morphine evoked sleep and death
<!-- * Named after Morpheus -->
* Morphine is an alkaloid

## Laudanum (Derived from opium)

* A Swiss-German occultist Paracelsus (1943-1541) discovered that opium dissolved better in alcohol than in water.
  * He named this solution laudanum
* English physician Thomas Sydenham (1624-1689) made his own recipe
* In the 1800s, laudanum was available by prescription
* In the 1900s, laws became more restrictive, regulating the production and sale of addictive compounds

## Codeine (Derived from opium)

* Composes 1-3% of opium
* In 1821, a French chemist Pierre Robiquet performed the process of O-methylation (substitution of an atom by a metal group) to isolate codeine from opium
* Many uses
  * Analgesic (Pain relief)
  * Antitussive (Coughing)
  * Antidiarrheal
  * Antihypertensive (Blood pressure)
  * Antianxiety
  * Sedative
  * Suppress premature labour contractions
  * Suppress myocardial infarction (heart attack)
* Has addictive potential, but is less potent than morpheine or heroin

## Heroin (Derived from opium)

* aka diacetylmorphine
* 1874 - English chemist Charles Wright synthesised heroin by accidentally boiling morphine with acetic acid for several hours.
  * This process of acetylation introduces an acetyl group into the compound
* The modern technique to create heroin is harder
* 1898 - German chemist Felix Hoffmann discovered aspirin by subjecting salicylic acid to the same process
  * The company he worked at (Bayer) marketed heroin as an effective sedative for coughs, but without the addictive potential
  * 1913 - Bayer ceased production as a result of the increased legislative laws
