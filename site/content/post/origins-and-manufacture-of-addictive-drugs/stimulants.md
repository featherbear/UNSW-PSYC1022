# Tobacco (Nicotine)

* Alkaloid
* Nicotine composes 0.6-3% of tobacco leaf
* Neurotoxic (to insects) and functions as an antiherbivore chemical

---

* History
  * 'Discovered' in 1492 by Christopher Columbus, where his men discovered tribal people smoking 'half-burned wood in their hands'
  * 1492 - Rodrigo de Jerez - considered the first European smoker
    * Introduced tobacco to Ayamonte, Spain
    * Was imprisoned for 7 years (smoking was unheard of, thought to be of the devil)
  * 1604 - Stuart King James I denounced tobacco use as harmful to the brain and dangerous to the lungs
    * Tariffs on imports
  * Until 1883 - tobacco excise tax accounted for 1/3 of internal revenue collected by the US government
  * 1962 - Causal link between smoking, lung cancer, bronchitis and cardiovascular disease
  * There was debate between restricting tobacco use, as it brought in a lot of income for the government

# Cocaine

* Alkaloid
* Derived from the leaves of the coca plant
* Antiherbivore chemical
* Naturally grows in South America

---

* History
  * Research of plant remains revealed that coca leaves were consumed by many South American native groups
  * Mummies in Northern Chile (1000BC)
  * Nanchoc Valley, Peru (6000BC) - Evidence of coca leaf production
  * 1500s - The Spanish conquistadors immediately disregarded coca leaves and cocaine, until they observed that the enslaved natives worked harder whilst under its influence
  * 1600s - Cocaine was introduced to Spain
  * 1858 - Italian neurologist Paolo Mantegazza highlighted the cognitive enhancing effects of coca leaf infusions
  * 1855 - The cocaine alkaloid was first isolated by German chemist, Friedrich Gaedcke - who named it "erythroxyline"
  * 1860 - Albert Niemann's published a better extraction process in his PhD, which is the basis of the current technique.
    * Coca leaves -> coca paste -> coke base -> cocaine hydrochloride

---

## Cocaine Hydrochloride

* Injected, snorted or taken orally
* Vaporises at 197 degrees celsius, so it is not smoked.
* If attempted to be smoked, the alkaloid is destroyed, giving a weak high and foul taste

## Freebase Cocaine

* Precipitate from cocaine hydrochloride dissolved in water, diethyl ether and ammonia
* Vaporises at 98 degrees celsius, so it is smoked.

---

* Dangers
  * Residual ammonia in the extracted precipitate is damaging to the lungs
  * Diethyl ether (used during production) is highly flammable

## Crack Cocaine

* Dissolved cocaine hydrochloride in water and sodium bicarbonate (baking powder) that form cystalised precipitates
* Crackles when smoked (hence its name)

# Amphetamines

* Derived from the Epehdra plant, used in Chinese medicine to treat asthma, hay fever and colds.
* Purported to increase alertness, but it may have been a placebo
  * i.e. World War II

---

* History
  * 1885 - Japanese chemist Nagai Nagayoshi extracted the ephedrine
  * 1887 - Romanian chemist Lazar Edeleanu attempted to make a synthetic ephedrine
    * Named this substance phenylisopropylamine, named from the starting compound P2P (phenyl-2-propanone)
  * 1920s - Shortage of ephedrine due to a civil war in China
  * 1933 - An inhaler called Benzedrine was released, which acted as a decongestant for blocked nose and asthma
  * 1960s - Benzedrine inhalers were banned, prescription amphetamine regulations came into effect

# Methamphetamine

* History
  * 1885 - Nagai (Dude who created Amphetamines) continued his research into chemical manipulation of ephedrine led to the creation of meth powder)
  * 1919 - Akira Ogata develoepd crystal methamphetamine (ice)
    * Simpler to produce
    * Simpler chemical structure to amphetamine
    * Addition of the methyl group, making it easier to absorb
  * 1939-1945 - Germany widely manufactured and distributed millions of tablets
