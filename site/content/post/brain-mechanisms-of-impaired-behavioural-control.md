Damage to the frontal lobe can affect brain mechanisms, including drug use control.

The frontal lobe is intricately interconnected, and there is no clear-cut cause-effect understanding of each area of the cortex

# Orbitofrontal Cortex (OFC)

* Encodes the expected value of rewards (drug)
* Encodes the costs associated with rewards (expected harms)
* Switching reward target when the payoff is reduced
* Foresight into future consequences of reward-seeking behaviour

**_RELATED TO THE AFFECTIVE COMPONENT OF THE BRAIN_**

## Study: Phineas Gage

Had a steel rod punch through his skull during a work accident. His left frontal lobe was damaged. Following recovery his social behaviour changed drastically, however his intellect was unhindered (including memory and planning)

## Study: Frontal Lobotomy

Moniz (1935) was interested in the effects of the ablation of the prefrontal cortex in chimps. One of them was apparently "cured" of an "experimental neurosis"  
  
A lobotomy practitioner, Freeman, believed the frontal lobe was involved in the ability to project an image of the individual into the future, coupled with a recognition of this image as the self. He also believed that the frontal lobes provided an emotional connection with the self to the image.

> "Prefrontal lobotomy bleaches the affective component connected with the consciousness of the self" - Dolan, 2007

## Study: Pavlovian Instrumental Transfer

Rats with lesions were unable to transfer their response behaviours

## Study: Cigarette Video

Expectations of drug rewards evoked by drug cues are encoded in the OFC

## Trigger

**When the relative value is higher than the alternative, the OFC cells fire.**

**Level of activation of OFC is related to the spike frequency**

## Costs

O'Doherty et al, 2001 - had S+ tasks (overall gain) and S- (overall loss).  
OFC responds to wins, but the lateral parts responded to losses.

> OFC is important for encoding both reward and punishment signals

### Reversal Learning

Hornak, 2004 ran patients with damage to their OFC on the same task.  
Participants would simply have to choose S+ tasks over S- tasks

After the first 13 trials, S+ and S- were reversed.  
Patients with bilateral damage continued to choose the old S+ stimuli.  
Patients with only unilateral damage, or damage to another frontal region, or no damage at all learned the new stimulus-reward relationship

> Damage to the OFC impairs the ability to re-learn things. Learning things originally is still okay

#### Cocaine Usage

Stalnaker et al, 2006.

The overall percentage of rats under the influence of cocaine for two weeks that responded to a foul odour was less than the control percentage.

Cocaine alters the encoding of expected punishment in the OFC.

### Time Costs

Roesch & Olsen, 2007.

### Delay Discounting

> Choice of a smaller reward now, or a larger reward later

As the delay increased, the value decreases (loss of interest)

> Damage to the OFC may be responsible for individuals being less able to control drug intake

# Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLPFC)

* Foresight into future consequences of behaviour
* Exerting contextual modulation of expected reward calculations made by the OFC
* Enhancing or decreasing expected drug value in circumstances
* Left DLPFC - Long term rewards and goals
  * Reponsible for increasing craving in response to the immediate availability

OFC encodes the value placed onto rewards.  
Left DLPFC was more active for the self-control group

Higher activity when the smokers believed that they could smoke immediately after the video
