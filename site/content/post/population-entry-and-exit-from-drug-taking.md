According to the 2016 statistics, 43% of Australians have used illicit drugs once in their lifetime.

* 15.6% used recently
* 8.6% used within the last month
* 5.6% used within the last week

> **Only a small proportion of people who ever try drugs become frequent users**  
_13.4% risk (Anthony et al. 1994)_  
Rule of thumb: 20% risk

## Waste Water Analysis

Self-reported statistics are only partially valid, as people can submit false results. A waste water analysis in Adelaide showed that Methamphetamine was the most prevalent drug used, despite the statistics saying that MDMA was the most used.

<!-- Methamphetamine
Cocaine
MDMA -->

## Prevalence By Age

* 9% of users 14-19
* 32% of users are aged 20-29
* 11.5% of users are aged 50-59
* 10.9% of users are aged 60+

_Australia has an aging population of illicit drug users_

---

## Adolescent Onset: Alcohol

* Age of first use: 17.3

Peak consumers are 70+ years.

The number of daily users has been decreasing since 2004.

## Adolescent Onset: Tobacco

* Age of first use: 16.3

---

# Demographic Risk Factors

## Family

i.e. association with drug-using peer groups.  
Parents, siblings, past criminality, extreme poverty, broken families, abuse, low parent-child attachment, commitments to school

### Sibling

* Risk increases when the relative age between siblings is 0-4
* Stable until a difference of 10

> Vygotsky - Zone of proximal development

* Risk increases when siblings are of the same gender
* Risk increases when the drug dependent sibling is older
* Shared experiences of a common risky environment

## Community

Drug availability, neighbourhood, community prevalence

## Society

Levels of law enforcement, tax, price, regulation

# Drug Expectancy

Risk factors function to increase positive drug expectancies and decrease negative expectancies (Leventhal, 2006)

* Transmission of parental beliefs (_demographic risk factor_)

# Early Onset

* Probability of dependency increases with duration of use
* Probability of dependency increases with earlier age
* Probability of dependency increases with parental beliefs and support

# Drug Liking

* Probability of dependency increases with liking of the initial experience

> Note: **Positive correlation is not causation**.  
>   
> Correlation: Ice cream on a hot day.  
> Ice cream sales do not cause hot weather.
> Hot weather does not cause ice cream sales.

## Accuracy of Statistics

Addicts may have conflated experiences - believing that their initial experience was better than it was at the time.

Fergusson's cannabis model queried the users at an earlier time after their initial use.  

A follow up (2 years after) revealed that:

* 12.4% of those who said that they **did not** get high during the initial experience, became dependent 
* 34.1% of those who said that they did not get really high in early experiences, became dependent
* Negative experiences did not modify the risk of later dependence

## Development Trajectories of Smoking

* Early Stable Smoking - Associated with parents and peers who smoked
  * Frequency ceiling is higher than late stable smokers
* Late stable
* Quitter
* Experimenter

# Chippers

People who maintain a low level of drug users over a period of time, but are not dependent.

i.e. people who take a prescribed ritual (i.e. only doing drugs at raves, only one a night)

---

# Life History (study of 10 opiate addicts)

* Bouts of use followed by abstinence then relapse then abstinence, etc
* Addiction is a chronically relapsing disorder

# Gateway Hypothesis

The idea that experimentation precedes the use of marijuana, pills, snorting, injecting

* Different drugs might compliment one another - smoking and alcohol
* A drug may be used to counteract the withdrawal phase of another drug
* Substitution when the primary drug is unavailable
* Cross-sensitisation - enhance senses and brain reward systems
* 'Common syndrome' - "try the others"

---

# Drug Exit

<!-- typically starts at adolescence, and usually ends around 30-65 -->

## Natural Recovery

80% - largely undertaken by individuals 30-40 years old, who have used drugs for 5-15 years (Sobell et al 2000, Price et al 2001)

## Exit Treatments

* Availability and Acceptability
* Legal Referral from Courts or Criminal Sanctions
* Prior experience of treatment

Treatment seekers are also characterised by a higher incidence of psychiatric symptoms

## Cigarette Usage

Whilst most other drugs decease in usage over time, smoking remains stable.
