# Positive and Negative Reinforcement

* Positive reinforcement occurs during the beginning of the development of an addiction
* Negative reinforcement comes into play when tolerance (increasing reward thresholds) appears to develop into positive reinforcement

## Agreements

They agree with each other about the early and late stages of addiction

# Disagreements

1. The time between early and late at which the diagnosis of addiction is considered
2. The relative importance of positive and negative reinforcement
3. The degree to which the specifics of negative reinforcement can be generalised across the range of addictive agents

***

## When is something considered addictive?

* There is no scientific definition to define addiction.
* Should we use the word 'addiction' or 'dependence'
  * But does this help?
* The word 'addiction' means different things to different people
  * The condition of addiction
  * The process of addiction

Opiate addiction causes users to progressively consume higher doses to maintain the effectiveness as experienced during initial drug taking.

> Are the withdrawal effects of not taking opiates the reason for wanting to continue using opiates?

* Continued use becomes required to avoid the withdrawal syndromes
* Compulsive dug intake can develop _before_ the development of physiological dependence
  * Rats will self-administer morphine without signs of tolerance or dependence, yet they will not self-administer the dug in locations where it does cause classic dependence signs
* Whilst dependence theory was central to early theories, it did not explain the self-administation of psychomotor stimulants (cocaine, amphetamines)
* Drug self-administration does not cause addiction
* Rats and monkeys that learn to respond regularly to IV cocaine will likely take cocaine to the point of convulsion or death, many reached the point of feeling painful footshock.

> "Simple unfettered exposure to the drug (IV cocaine, amphetamines, heroin) is a sufficient condition for addiction in rats"
