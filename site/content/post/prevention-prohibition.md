> Programs only produced small effects, but are justifiable as per their cost-effectiveness

# Healthy Harold

Government allocates additional school funding to educate children about drugs.  
Inefficient unless there are safeguards to prevent the misappropriation of funds, and that support is given to teachers for the delivery of education material.

Programs exist from third-party agencies who have been trained to do these educational talks.

# Ineffectiveness of Prevention Programs

> If you knew the harm you would choose the behaviour less frequently

Risks to users are often greatly exaggerated (scare mongering) in terms of their addictiveness and damage. Often, youth who observed peers smoking marijuana without any (apparent) immediate harm would quickly disregard (and in the future, ignore) any provided information

Modern prevention strategies provide accurate information, as to not be discredited in the future; which also helps youth make rational choices through training self-efficacy and their ability to resist peer influences.

# "Just Say No"

US prevention campaign launched by First Lady Nancy Raegan, as part of the war on drugs in the 1980s-1990s.

It was difficult to evaluate the efficacy of the campaign

# Project ALERT

Launched in the 1980s, it provided experimental evidence that training in the ability to "say no", _does_ have some small efficacy in pushing back the age of drug use onset.

Based on social influence models to promote the benefits of the non-use of drugs

The project only seemed to work while it was running, as after children moved into high school (no longer in the scope of Project ALERT), any gains had vanished. However, it does help to push back the age of onset

# Project DARE

> **D**rug **A**buse **R**esistance **E**ducation

Created in an effort to reduce drug use, gang membership and violent behaviour

Delivered in schools by police officers, however there seemed to be no significant effect

## Project Keepin' it REAL

> **R**efuse **E**xplain **A**void **L**eave

Adaptation of Project DARE.

Helps students assess the risks associated with substance abuse, enhance decision making and resistance strategies, improve antidrug normative beliefs and reduce substance use. It takes a culturally grounded approach, incorporating traditional ethnic values and practices that forbid/deter substance use

# Meta-analysis of Programs

What's the crucial element that successfully reduced short term drug use during these programs?

* Knowledge programs - Scare tactic
* Affective programs - Improve emotional risk factors (without reference to drugs)
* Peer programs - Knowledge of drug harms in a peer situation

Peer programs were the most efficable! (Tobler 2992, Midford 2010, Cuijpers 2002).  
Peer programs worked better when the program leader was a trained mental health professional, as opposed to just a teacher

# Cost-effectiveness of Prevention

> Caulkins et al 1999 estimated that prevention programs produced a 2.9 - 13.6% reduction in cocaine use. **Note that these percentages differ significantly, and the cost-effectiveness of programs are viewed relative to the perception of the reduction as having a low, middle or high effect**

Treatment was the most cost-effective  
Federal enforcement followed  
Then prevention  
Increase in minimum sentence duration  
State police enforcement
