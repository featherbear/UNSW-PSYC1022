> Negative reinforcement makes addicts want to take drugs (as to remove the pain)

# Self Administration

A study on rats suggests that they err on the positive effects of the drugs, rather than because the rat has acquired a withdrawal syndrome, tolerance or conditioned withdrawal / conditioned tolerance

Drugs increase sensitivity to the rewarding effects, however it can displace the pursuit of other rewards (i.e. food from hunger) which can be harmful (i.e. not eating)

## Choice

For binary choice procedures (i.e take the drug or not) - most animals developed self administration behaviours

For concurrent choice procedures...  
Ahmed (2012) found that in a group of 184 rats, 20% of the rats developed a preference for cocaine, whilst the remaining 80% preferred saccharin

> This is similar to human epidemiological data, that 20% of people who try drugs become dependent

### Herrnstein's Matching Law

Choices are allocated between two options in accordance with the relative frequency of rewards earned by those choices.

B1/B2 = R1/R2

* B - behaviour
* R - frequency of reward

## Bias

When there are different rewards available, bias can influence choice

## Demand Curve

Low price -> High demand  
Higher price -> Less demand

Taxes and high prices of drugs aim to reduce the demand

## Decision Theory

![](/uploads/snipaste_2021-01-21_12-57-15.png)

The brain makes decisions based on a number of factors

* Value of each reward
* Probability of the response producing that reward
* Costs associated with the reward (time, money, potential harm)

These values are combined to calculate the **utility** of each choice, and the reward with the greatest utility is pursued.

> Drug dependence may be driven simply as a result of the drug having a higher reward value

## Behavioural Sensitisation

After chronic exposure, a sensitised response to the drug is developed - rather than as a result of residual drug existence
